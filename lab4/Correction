When running the main code, we noticed that the program went to a HARD_FAULT_ERROR or entered the Error_Handler after storing five data points (arrays) or 50 data points (integers) in flash. 
This occurred because Flash was not used correctly and functioned as RAM, causing us to run out of space very quickly.

Instead of erasing blocks immediately after saving and reading data, we should only erase them once before using the flash. 
By doing so, we can store and hold data permanently.

There are four sets of data, each from a sensor on the board. Hence, the four sets of data should be saved separately, i.e., saved in four different blocks. 
To do so, we need to calculate the offset address of each block and save each set of data using the offset address.
