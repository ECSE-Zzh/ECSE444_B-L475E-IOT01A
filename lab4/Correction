In lab 4, the Flash is not correctly used and is functioned as RAM.

Instead of erasing blocks immediately after saving and reading data, we should only erase them once before using the flash.
By doing so, we can store and hold data permanently.

There are four sets of data, each of which is from a sensor on the board. Hence, the four sets of data should be saved separately (i.e. save them in four different blocks).
To do so, we need to calculate the offset address of each block and save each set of data using the offset address.
